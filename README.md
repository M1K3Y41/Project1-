Global Cryptocurrency Stats Fetcher This Python script fetches and displays global cryptocurrency statistics from the Coinlore API.

Overview The script retrieves global cryptocurrency data such as the total number of coins, active markets, total market cap, volume, and dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum. It fetches the data from the Coinlore API and outputs it in a readable format.

Requirements Python 3.13 IDLE No additional libraries are required (uses built-in urllib and json libraries).

Copy the code and paste it into a notepad, save and name (crypto_stats.py). Open the file in Python 3.13 IDLE and Run Module. 

The output should give the following:

Total Coins Active Markets Total Market Cap 24h Trading Volume Bitcoin Dominance Ethereum Dominance Market Cap Change (24h) Volume Change (24h) Average Price Change (24h) All-Time High Market Cap All-Time High Volume


Note: I'm running into issues running the code through Python 3.13 IDLE. Pasting into a notepad and running on IDLE seems to work flawlessly.
